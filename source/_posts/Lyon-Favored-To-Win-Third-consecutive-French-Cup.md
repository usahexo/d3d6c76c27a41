#  Lyon Favored To Win Third consecutive French Cup

Lyon is set to play its semifinal match in the French Cup against Caen on Wednesday, and they are heavily favored to win. This would be their third consecutive victory in the French Cup, and it would be a huge accomplishment for the club.

Lyon is currently in first place in the Ligue 1 table, so they are playing very well this season. They have been winning matches left and right, and they seem to be unstoppable. They will definitely be looking to continue their winning streak in the French Cup as well.

Caen is not a very strong opponent, so Lyon should have no trouble defeating them. However, they cannot take them lightly, as anything can happen in a semifinal match. The players will need to perform at their best in order to secure a spot in the final.

This will likely be Lyon's last chance to win some silverware this season. With the Ligue 1 title all but locked up, they may start to focus more on the French Cup. Winning this competition would be a major accomplishment for them, and it would give them a lot of momentum going into next season.

#  Europa League Soccer: Lyon a Good Bet at Home

Europa League soccer is always a wild ride, and this year’s version is no different. One of the most interesting teams to watch so far has been Lyon. They are a good bet at home, but beware their away record.

Lyon got off to a great start in the group stage, winning all of their home games. They even managed to beat Hoffenheim, a team that was expected to finish ahead of them. However, their away form has been less impressive. They lost both of their away games, against Atalanta and Apollon Limassol.

This makes them something of a Jekyll and Hyde team – they are very strong at home, but less so away. This could be a problem in the later stages of the Europa League, when they will have to play away from home more often.

However, Lyon should still be considered favourites to win their group. They have the best home record out of all the teams in their group, and should be able to take advantage of that in the next round.

#  Lyonnais Forward Lacazette a Strong Bet for Golden Boot

It would be no surprise to see Lyon’s Alexandre Lacazette top the scorer charts by the end of this season. He has been in scintillating form so far, with 22 goals in 27 appearances in all competitions. This is a player who is not only lethal in front of goal, but also has the work rate and team-first mentality that are essential for success in the modern game.

Lacazette is a natural born goalscorer, and his tally of 85 goals in just over 200 appearances for Lyon speaks volumes. He has an impressive scoring record at international level as well, with 9 goals in 16 appearances for France. At just 26 years old, Lacazette still has plenty of time to improve and could potentially become one of the world’s best strikers.

The biggest challenge for Lacazette this season will be to fire Lyon into the Champions League. They are currently in 5th place in Ligue 1, but are just 4 points off 2nd place Monaco with a game in hand. If Lacazette can continue his prolific form and help Lyon finish in the top 3, then he will be in contention for the Golden Boot award.

There are several other strikers who could challenge for the Golden Boot this season, including Sergio Aguero, Diego Costa and Harry Kane. However, Lacazette is arguably one of the most deadly finishers in Europe right now and he is definitely worth backing at odds of 7/1 to win the award.

#  Atalanta vs Olympique Lyonnais: Odds & Analysis

When Atalanta faces Olympique Lyonnais in their first leg of the Champions League Round of 16 on Wednesday, it will be a matchup of David and Goliath. The Italian side is a solid club but they are nowhere near the level of Lyon.

Olympique Lyonnais sit in third place in Ligue 1, while Atalanta are ninth in Serie A. The French side has also been much more impressive in Europe this season. They topped their group with five wins from six matches, while Atalanta finished second in their group behind Manchester City.

That’s not to say that Lyon are without weaknesses. They have struggled for goals recently, managing just four in their past five games across all competitions. However, they should have enough firepower to get the better of Atalanta.

The Italian club is coming into this match on the back of two defeats, including a 3-0 loss at home to Juventus last time out. That result leaves them with just one win from their past five games in all competitions.
