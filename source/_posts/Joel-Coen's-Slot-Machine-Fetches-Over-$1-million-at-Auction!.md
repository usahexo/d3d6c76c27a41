#  Joel Coen's Slot Machine Fetches Over $1 million at Auction!

Hollywood director Joel Coen's slot machine recently fetched over $1 million at auction! This makes it one of the most expensive pieces of movie memorabilia ever sold.

The slot machine was used in the making of the 2000 film "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" and was played by George Clooney and John Turturro in the movie. The Clooney-Turturro duo won a 2000 Academy Award for Best Song for their rendition of "Man of Constant Sorrow."

So why did this particular slot machine go for such a high price at auction? Well, according to experts, it may have something to do with the fact that it's one of only two machines known to still exist from the original set used in the movie. And since "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" is considered a cult classic, demand for memorabilia from the film is high.

In addition to the slot machine, other items from the "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" set that have sold for high prices include George Clooney's prison ball and chain ($8,000) and John Turturro's guitar ($47,500).

The machine is one of only six ever made and was used in the film to reward Javier Bardem's character Anton Chigurh with money for his kills.

So why did Sean Parker buy the slot machine? There is no clear answer, but there are a few possible explanations.
