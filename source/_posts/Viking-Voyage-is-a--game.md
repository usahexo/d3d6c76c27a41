#  Viking Voyage is a  game?

According to Norse mythology, the world was created in a vast ocean called the 
"Ginnungagap". The first beings to emerge from the Ginnungagap were the ice 
giant Ymir and the cow Audumla. From Ymir's flesh came forth Burr, the father of all 
giants, and from Audumla's udders flowed four rivers of milk that fed Burr and the 
giants.


 Odin and his two brothers, Vili and Ve, were also born from the Ginnungagap. The three 
brothers decided to create their own world, separate from that of their parents. They slew 
Ymir and used his body to create the land, mountains, skies, and seas. From his blood they 
created the Trolls, from his bones the Dwarves, from his hair the plants and trees, and
from his brains the clouds.


The gods then created humans from tree logs that had been carved with faces. The first man 
was named Ask, and the first woman was named Embla. The gods gave them life and set them in 
the new world they had created.


Odin was not pleased with his new creations however, as they were weak and feeble. He feared 
that they would not be able to survive in the harsh new world he had created for them. So he 
gave them some of his own power, making them immune to cold weather and hunger. He also set 
a Midgard Serpent at the edge of the world to guard it against invaders.

In Viking Voyage you play as one of Odin's sons - either Thor or Loki - sent down to earth to help humanity defeat Ymir and protect Midgard from other threats. Along the way you'll gather allies (such as Thor's hammer Mjollnir) to help you in your quest, defeat enemies in epic battles, and save mankind!
