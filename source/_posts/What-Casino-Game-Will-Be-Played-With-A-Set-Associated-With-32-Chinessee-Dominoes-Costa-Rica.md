# What Casino Game Will Be Played With A Set Associated With 32 Chinessee Dominoes Costa Rica?

A game of casino that is played with a set of 32 Chinese dominoes can be found in Costa Rica. This game is called Cachito and is quite popular in the country. The object of the game is to score as many points as possible by matching dominoes.

Each player is dealt seven dominoes, which they must keep concealed from the other players. The player who holds the double-six tile begins the game and play passes to the left. On a player's turn, they must play one domino from their hand, connecting it to one end of the chain already played. If the player cannot play, they must draw from the boneyard until they can play.

The winner is the first player to play all their dominoes, or the player with the fewest dominoes at the end of the game. The winner scores points for each pip on their remaining dominoes. The first player to reach 100 points (or more) wins the game.
