2. Next, cut out the center of the board using scissors or a craft knife. You should now have a 12"x12" square in the middle of the board.

#  Making Bingo Fun and Exciting in Burundi

Bingo is one of the most popular games in the world and is enjoyed by people of all ages. It is usually played in a group setting and can be both fun and exciting. Despite its popularity, there are some countries where Bingo is not very popular. Burundi is one of those countries.

There are several reasons why Bingo is not popular in Burundi. Firstly, the game requires basic mathematical skills, which most Burundians lack. Secondly, most Burundians are not familiar with the game's rules. Finally, the cost of purchasing the necessary equipment (cards, markers, etc.) is prohibitive for many people in the country.

Nonetheless, there are a few people in Burundi who enjoy playing Bingo. One way to make the game more exciting and fun for them is to modify the rules slightly. For example, instead of having players mark off B-I-N-G-O on their cards, you could have them mark off any sequence of five letters or numbers. This would make the game more challenging and interesting for players.

Another way to make Bingo more exciting is to spice up the prizes that are awarded to winners. Instead of giving small amounts of money as prizes, you could give vouchers or other types of rewards that can be used or enjoyed by players.

If you want to introduce Bingo to Burundi, it might be a good idea to hold free workshops where people can learn how to play the game properly. You could also organize friendly tournaments where participants can compete against each other for prizes.
