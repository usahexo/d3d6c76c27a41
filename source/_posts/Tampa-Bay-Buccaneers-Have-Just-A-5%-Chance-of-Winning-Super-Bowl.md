#  Tampa Bay Buccaneers Have Just A 5% Chance of Winning Super Bowl

In the latest ESPN power rankings, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers are ranked No. 21. In Football Outsiders' DVOA ratings, they come in at No. 24. FPI has them with a 5 percent chance to win the Super Bowl, and there's not a lot of optimism among fans, either: Only 12 percent of tickets for the Bucs' Week 1 game against the Saints have been sold.

The good news for Tampa Bay is that it looks like it should be a much better team in 2018 than it was in 2017. The Bucs were dead last in offensive DVOA last year and had one of the worst defenses in football. They were also hampered by injuries, particularly on offense.

FanGraphs projects Tampa Bay to finish 11-5 this year, which would be a huge improvement. But even with an improved record, the Bucs are still not a very good team. The NFL is a league of parity, and there are no guarantees in football. Tampa Bay could easily finish 8-8 or worse this year.

The Saints are coming off of one of the best seasons in NFL history and are currently ranked as the No. 1 team in the league by both ESPN and Football Outsiders. The odds are heavily against Tampa Bay winning this game, but there's always a chance that the Bucs could pull off an upset.

#  Bucs Place Second In NFC South With just 7-9 Record

The Tampa Bay Buccaneers finished their season 7-9 and second in the NFC South. Although they did not make it to the playoffs, this season was still a success for the Bucs.

This year’s Buccaneer squad was led by quarterback Jameis Winston. Winston had a strong season, despite missing three games due to suspension. In 13 games, he threw for over 4,000 yards and 30 touchdowns. He also had 15 interceptions.

Another standout player for Tampa Bay this season was wide receiver Mike Evans. Evans had 1,251 receiving yards and eight touchdowns. He was one of the most explosive players in the NFL this year.

The Bucs’ defense was also strong this year. They were led by linebacker Lavonte David and defensive tackle Gerald McCoy. David led the team in tackles with 138, while McCoy had nine sacks.

Overall, the Bucs had an inconsistent season but showed flashes of brilliance at times. If they can continue to improve next year, they could be contenders for the Super Bowl

#  Bucs’ Season Ends with 35-28 Playoff Loss to the Falcons

With top seed in the NFC playoffs and momentum on their side, the Atlanta Falcons were too much for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to handle, winning 35-28.

The Buccaneer defense was unable to stop Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan and wide receiver Julio Jones all game long. Ryan completed 26 of 36 passes for 338 yards and three touchdowns, two of them to Jones.

Tampa Bay quarterback Jameis Winston had a decent game, completing 22 of 38 passes for 299 yards and three touchdowns. His favorite target was wide receiver Mike Evans, who caught seven passes for 147 yards and two touchdowns.

Both teams scored a touchdown in the first quarter. Tampa Bay took a 14-7 lead into halftime after Evans caught a nine-yard touchdown pass from Winston with six seconds remaining in the second quarter.

Atlanta came back with 21 unanswered points in the third quarter. The Falcons led 28-14 after Ryan connected with Jones on an 85-yard touchdown pass late in the third quarter.

Tampa Bay made a comeback attempt in the fourth quarter, scoring twice to cut the Atlanta lead to 28-28. However, Ryan’s third touchdown pass of the day gave Atlanta a 35-28 lead that they would not relinquish.

The Bucs’ season ends with a record of 9-7.

#  Despite high expectations, Tampa Bay Buccaneers struggle early on

The Tampa Bay Buccaneers were supposed to be one of the breakout teams of the NFL this season. They boast one of the best young quarterbacks in the league in Jameis Winston, and a number of dynamic playmakers on both sides of the ball. However, they have yet to find success early on in the season, with a record of 2-3 through their first five games.

Their biggest issue has been their lack of consistency on offense. Winston has been up and down throughout the season, and the team has had trouble establishing a consistent running game. This has led to a lot of close defeats, including three games that they have lost by six points or less.

However, there is still plenty of time for the Bucs to turn things around. They have some very talented players and should be able to compete with anyone in the league if they can find some consistency. Winston will need to play better if they want to make a playoff run, but there is no reason they can’t get hot down the stretch and make some noise in the postseason.

#  A Look at the Odds: 2017 Tampa Bay Buccaneers

The 2017 Tampa Bay Buccaneers are coming into the season with some pretty high expectations. After a 9-7 record last year, and adding several key players in the offseason, many people are predicting that this will be the year that the Bucs finally make it to the playoffs.

There is no denying that this team has a lot of talent. In quarterback Jameis Winston, wide receiver Mike Evans, and running back Doug Martin, they have three of the best offensive players in the league. The defense has also been improved, with additions like defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul and cornerback Brent Grimes.

So what are the odds for the Buccaneers this season?

Las Vegas currently has them at 14-1 to win the Super Bowl, which puts them behind teams like the Patriots (5-1), Steelers (8-1), and Packers (10-1). They are also 5th in the NFC South division, behind teams like the Falcons (11-5) and Panthers (6-10).

All that being said, I think there is a good chance that the Buccaneers will surprise a lot of people this year and make a run at the playoffs. They have a very strong offense, and their defense has been improved as well. If they can stay healthy and play up to their potential, I definitely think they have a chance to make it to the postseason.
