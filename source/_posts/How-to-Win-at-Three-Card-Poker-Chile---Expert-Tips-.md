#  Advice for Beating the Casino in Three Card Poker Chile

When playing Three Card Poker Chile, it is important to understand the basic rules of the game. In this game, you are playing against the dealer, not other players. The goal is to have a hand that is better than the dealers. You can either bet on your hand or bet on the dealers hand.

There are three different types of hands in Three Card Poker Chile- a Pair, Two Pair, or Three of a Kind. In order to win, your hand must beat the dealers hand. If you have a Pair, Two Pair, or Three of a Kind, your odds of winning are higher. However, if you have a High Card (a hand with no pairs), your odds of winning are lower.

In order to increase your chances of winning when playing Three Card Poker Chile, there are a few tips that you can follow:

1) Always bet on your hand. When you bet on your hand, you are betting that your hand will be better than the dealers. This increases your odds of winning.

2) Pay attention to the cards that are revealed. When the first two cards are revealed, take note of whether or not you have a good chance of beating the dealers hand. If you dont think you have a good chance of winning based on the revealed cards, then fold and dont risk any more money.

3) Try to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. In general, the best hand in Three Card Poker Chile is 21 (an Ace and two other card). If you can get close to 21 without going over, you will have a better chance of winning than if you have a high card hand.

4) Dont be afraid to fold if you dont like your chances. If the dealers first two cards are an Ace and a King for example, its likely that his next card will be another high number which will give him a better chance at beating your hand. In this case, its better to fold and save your money rather than risk losing it all.
