This makes it one of the most expensive pieces of movie memorabilia ever sold.</p>
<p>The slot machine was used in the making of the 2000 film “O Brother, Where Art Thou?” and was played by George Clooney and John Turturro in the movie. The Clooney-Turturro duo won a 2000 Academy Award for Best Song for their rendition of “Man of Constant Sorrow.”</p>
<p>So why did this particular slot machine go for such a high price at auction? Well, according to experts, it may have something to do with the fact that it’s one of only two machines known to still exist from the original set used in the movie. And since “O Brother, Where Art Thou?” is considered a cult classic, demand for memorabilia from the film is high.</p>
<p>In addition to the slot machine, other items from the “O Brother, Where Art Thou?” set that have sold for high prices include George Clooney’s prison ball and chain ($8,000) and John Turturro’s guitar ($47,500).</p>
<h1 id="Who-is-the-mystery-buyer-of-Joel-Coen’s-Slot-Machine"><a href="#Who-is-the-mystery-buyer-of-Joel-Coen’s-Slot-Machine" class="headerlink" title="Who is the mystery buyer of Joel Coen’s Slot Machine?"></a>Who is the mystery buyer of Joel Coen’s Slot Machine?</h1><p>There is no mystery about who bought Joel Coen’s slot machine at auction. In fact, the buyer was quite open about it,even tweeting a picture of the purchase. The buyer, according to reports, was Sean Parker, co-founder of Napster and an early investor in Facebook.</p>
<p>Coen’s slot machine was a hit at the auction, selling for $US750,000. It was one of several items from the Coen brothers’ “No Country for Old Men” that were up for auction. The machine is one of only six ever made and was used in the film to reward Javier Bardem’s character Anton Chigurh with money for his kills.</p>
<p>So why did Sean Parker buy the slot machine? There is no clear answer, but there are a few possible explanations.</p>
<p>One possibility is that he plans to use it as a prop in one of his upcoming films. Parker has been involved in several films as a producer and actor, including “The Social Network” and “The Founders”.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that he plans to install it in his private casino. Parker has been known to be a big fan of gambling, and has even made investments in online casinos.</p>
<p>A third possibility is that he plans to donate it to a museum or another art institution. Parker is known for his support of art and culture, and has donated millions of dollars to various causes over the years.</p>
<p>Whatever Sean Parker’s reasons may be, it’s clear that he is a big fan of the Coen brothers’ work. The slot machine will certainly be a coveted addition to his collection.</p>

The game is available for anyone to play online for free, and it is very popular.
