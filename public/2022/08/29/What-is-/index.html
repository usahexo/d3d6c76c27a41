<p>Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot use insulin properly. Insulin is a hormone that helps the body convert sugar, starches, and other food into energy. The three common types of diabetes are type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, and gestational diabetes.</p>
<p>Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease where the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin. This type of diabetes usually develops in children and young adults, and people with type 1 diabetes must take insulin every day to survive.</p>
<p>Type 2 diabetes is the most common type of diabetes and accounts for about 90% of all cases. In this type of diabetes, the body does not use insulin well and the pancreas may not produce enough insulin. People with type 2 diabetes often need to take medication to control their blood sugar level.</p>
<p>Gestational diabetes is a form of Type 2 Diabetes that occurs during pregnancy when blood sugar levels are too high. Most women who have gestational diabetes can control their blood sugar levels by modifying their diet and exercising regularly. However, some women will require medication or insulin treatment to keep their blood sugar levels under control.</p>
