This news comes as a shock to many of the casino’s regular guests, who are now scrambling to figure out what they’ll do without their favorite gaming destination.</p>
<p>The Boardwalk Casino has been a staple of Sea Isle City’s tourism industry for years, offering guests a wide range of table games and slot machines. In recent months, however, the casino has been faced with financial difficulties, reportedly owing millions of dollars to various creditors. It seems that this mounting debt was ultimately too much for the casino to overcome, and it was forced to close its doors for good.</p>
<p>While the closure of the Boardwalk Casino is certainly unfortunate for those who frequented it, there are still plenty of other gaming options in the area. The Atlantic City casinos are just a short drive away, and there are also several smaller casinos located in Cape May County. So while the Boardwalk Casino is no longer an option, there are still plenty of other places where you can gamble in Sea Isle City.</p>

<p>There’s a wide range of games on offer, including blackjack, craps, roulette and poker. In addition, there are also a number of slot machines for players to enjoy. If you’re looking to win big before the casino closes for good, now’s your chance!</p>
<p>Players can buy-in to any of the tournaments for as little as $25. This gives everyone a fair chance to try and win some of the larger jackpots on offer. Alternatively, if you’re feeling lucky, you could also try your hand at one of the many blackjack or poker tables. With prizes up for grabs worth thousands of dollars, there’s plenty at stake!</p>
