However, many taxpayers may not be sure of the specific rules surrounding this deduction. Here is a rundown of the tax tips for deducting gambling losses in 2018.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Only losses from gambling activities can be deducted – not winnings.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gambling losses can only be deducted up to the amount of gambling income reported on your tax return.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You must itemize deductions in order to deduct gambling losses. This means that you cannot take the standard deduction and also claim gambling losses.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you have net losses from gambling activities for the year, you can deduct those losses as a miscellaneous itemized deduction on Schedule A of your tax return.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gambling losses are deductible regardless of whether you itemize or take the standard deduction.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In order to claim a deduction for gambling losses, you must report all of your gambling winnings on your tax return, even if you didn’t actually receive any money from the winning gamble.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gambling losses must be substantiated with documentation such as receipts, tickets, and confirmation numbers. Without this documentation, the IRS will not allow you to claim a deduction for your gambling losses.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="How-to-Report-Gambling-Winnings-and-Losses-on-Your-Tax-Return"><a href="#How-to-Report-Gambling-Winnings-and-Losses-on-Your-Tax-Return" class="headerlink" title="How to Report Gambling Winnings and Losses on Your Tax Return"></a>How to Report Gambling Winnings and Losses on Your Tax Return</h1><p>Are you a gambler? If you are, then you need to report your gambling winnings and losses on your tax return. Here’s how:</p>
<p>First, report your winnings in Part I of Schedule C. If you won more than $600 from gambling, you will need to report the amount of your winnings, as well as the date and location of the win.</p>
<p>Next, report your losses in Part II of Schedule C. If you lost more than $600 from gambling, you will need to report the amount of your losses, as well as the date and location of each loss.</p>
<p>You can deduct your gambling losses up to the amount of your gambling winnings. In other words, if your net income from gambling is negative (meaning that your losses exceed your winnings), then you cannot deduct any of your losses on your tax return.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that only “ordinary and necessary” expenses related to gambling can be deducted on your tax return. For example, casino chips and tickets are considered “gambling equipment” and cannot be deducted. However, travel expenses (like airfare, hotel room, and car rental) can be deducted if they were incurred in order to gamble.</p>
<p>Make sure that you keep good records of all of your gambling activity throughout the year. This includes receipts, cancelled checks, credit card statements, and so on. You will need this information to accurately report your winnings and losses on your tax return.</p>
<h1 id="Can-You-Deduct-Gambling-Losses"><a href="#Can-You-Deduct-Gambling-Losses" class="headerlink" title="Can You Deduct Gambling Losses?"></a>Can You Deduct Gambling Losses?</h1><p>Are you one of the many Americans who enjoy gambling? If so, you may be wondering if you can deduct your losses from your taxable income. The answer is yes, but there are a few things you need to know first.</p>
<p>To be able to deduct your gambling losses, you must itemize your deductions on your tax return. In addition, your losses must exceed the amount of your winnings. Finally, the deduction is only allowed for gambling activities that are considered “illegal” by the IRS. This includes casino games, lottery tickets, and wagers on sporting events.</p>
<p>If you meet all of these requirements, you can claim your losses as a miscellaneous deduction on Schedule A. The amount that you can deduct is limited to the amount of your income that is subject to tax. For example, if you have $10,000 in gambling losses and $6,000 in income that is subject to tax, you can only claim $6,000 in deductions.</p>
<p>Gambling losses are a valid deduction for tax purposes, but they are also considered a “red flag” by the IRS. This means that they may audit taxpayers who claim this deduction excessively. So if you plan to deduct your gambling losses, be sure to keep good records of your gambling activities. This includes receipts for any payments made and documentation of your winnings and losses.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Claim-Gambling-Losses-on-Your-Taxes"><a href="#How-to-Claim-Gambling-Losses-on-Your-Taxes" class="headerlink" title="How to Claim Gambling Losses on Your Taxes"></a>How to Claim Gambling Losses on Your Taxes</h1><p>If you’re like most people, you probably enjoy a good wager every now and then. But what do you do when those bets start to take a toll on your wallet? If you’ve been gambling and lost money, you may be able to claim your losses on your taxes.</p>
<p>Obviously, the first step is to make sure that you’re actually allowed to claim gambling losses. Not everyone is, so be sure to check with the IRS. Generally speaking, you can deduct your losses if:</p>
<p>-You itemize deductions on your tax return</p>
<p>-The gambling activity is legal</p>
<p>-You report the income from the activity on your tax return</p>
<p>-You claimed the gambling loss in the year it occurred<br>“In general, taxpayers may deduct gambling losses only if they have winnings from gambling to offset them,” said IRS spokesperson Jennifer Jenkins. “However, there are some exceptions.”</p>
<p>One such exception is if you incurred the losses in a professional gambling operation. For example, if you’re a full-time professional gambler and have net losses of more than $15,000 in a year, you can claim those losses as an adjustment to income. This rule does not apply to part-time or recreational gamblers.</p>
<p>Another exception applies to bad debts. If you have a debt that’s related to gambling (e.g., you lent someone money for a wager that never paid off), you may be able to claim it as a loss. However, this exception is limited to debts that are totally uncollectible. In other words, the creditor has given up trying to collect the debt and there’s no chance of recovering any of it.</p>
<p>So how do you go about claiming your gambling losses? The process is relatively straightforward:</p>
<ol>
<li>Report all of your gambling winnings and losses on Schedule A of your 1040 tax return. You’ll use Form 1040 Schedule A (PDF), Itemized Deductions, to figure out your adjusted gross income (AGI).</li>
<li>Subtract your total losses from your total winnings. This will give you your net loss for the year. 3) Deduct this amount from your AGI. This will reduce your taxable income for the year.4) If this reduces your taxable income below zero, you may not be able to claim a deduction for the loss (the IRS calls this “phantom income”). However, you can carry over this loss and deduct it from future years’ income until it’s used up completely . 5) Enter “GAMBLING LOSSES” in the description field of Form 1040 Schedule A .  6)Attach Form 1040 Schedule A to your tax return .</li>
</ol>
<p>Gambling can be a fun way to pass the time but it can also be costly if you’re not careful. By following these steps, however, you may be able to recoup some of those losses come tax time</p>
<h1 id="Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-Deducting-Gambling-Losses"><a href="#Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-Deducting-Gambling-Losses" class="headerlink" title="Everything You Need To Know About Deducting Gambling Losses"></a>Everything You Need To Know About Deducting Gambling Losses</h1><p>As a taxpayer, it’s important to understand the tax laws related to gambling. This includes being aware of the deduction you’re allowed for gambling losses. Here’s everything you need to know about deducting gambling losses:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Only gambling losses incurred in the taxable year can be deducted. This means that if you gamble during other years, those losses cannot be used to offset your income from gambling during the current year.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You can only claim a deduction for losses up to the amount of your winnings. For example, if you had $1,000 in winnings and $2,000 in losses, you can only claim a deduction for $1,000.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gambling losses must be itemized on Schedule A of your tax return. You cannot claim them as a standard deduction.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gambling losses are considered “Other Miscellaneous deductions.” This means that they are subject to a 2% AGI (adjusted gross income) limitation. In other words, you can only deduct the amount of your losses that exceeds 2% of your adjusted gross income.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you have net taxable income from gambling activities, you may have to pay taxes on that income. However, you can still claim a deduction for your losses.</p>
</li>
</ul>
