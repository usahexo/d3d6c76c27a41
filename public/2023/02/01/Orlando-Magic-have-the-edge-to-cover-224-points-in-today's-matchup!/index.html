<p>Coming into this game, the Magic were averaging 107.8 points per game while allowing opponents just 104.1 on average. Over their last 5 games, they are scoring 113 points per outing while only allowing 97.2 points per game to their opponents. This defense will look to shutdown the Miami Heat offense that is averaging 103.5 points per game this season.</p>
<p>Offensively for Orlando, they are led by Aaron Gordon and Nikola Vucevic who are both averaging over 17 points per game this season. They also have been getting solid contribution from Terrence Ross, Evan Fournier, and D.J. Augustin who are all averaging in double figures as well. Look for these players to lead the charge offensively against a struggling Miami Heat defense that is giving up over 111 points per game this season.</p>
<p>The Miami Heat will be looking to get some revenge for an earlier loss to the Magic this season, but they will not be able to do so today with the way Orlando is playing currently. Take the Magic to cover 224 points in today’s matchup!</p>
<h1 id="Get-in-on-the-Magic-to-cover-the-spread-they’re-primed-to-win-big-today"><a href="#Get-in-on-the-Magic-to-cover-the-spread-they’re-primed-to-win-big-today" class="headerlink" title="Get in on the Magic to cover the spread - they’re primed to win big today!"></a>Get in on the Magic to cover the spread - they’re primed to win big today!</h1><p>In the NFL, a lot of games come down to the wire. This is especially true in the later weeks of the season, as teams start to clinch their playoff berths and those at the bottom of the standings start to play for pride. In matchups such as these, picking the right side can be key to coming out ahead.</p>
<p>One way to increase your chances of winning is to take advantage of the betting lines. Many times, you can find a team that’s favored by more than three points and still cover the spread. This is because in close games, even a small margin can make all the difference.</p>
<p>Today’s game provides a perfect example. The Carolina Panthers are playing host to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and heading into kickoff, Carolina is a six-point favorite. However, given how evenly matched these two teams are, it would not be surprising if this game came down to the wire. In fact, in their last five meetings, each team has won twice.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a upset pick this week, look no further than Tampa Bay. They have had an impressive season considering they were expected to finish near the bottom of the division. And with Jameis Winston back under center, they definitely have the firepower to pull off an upset win today.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, it all comes down to making smart selections and using Las Vegas odds to your advantage. So don’t be afraid to take some risks - after all, that’s what makes gambling so exciting!</p>
<h1 id="Bet-on-Orlando-to-beat-the-224-point-spread-and-enjoy-a-solid-payout"><a href="#Bet-on-Orlando-to-beat-the-224-point-spread-and-enjoy-a-solid-payout" class="headerlink" title="Bet on Orlando to beat the 224-point spread and enjoy a solid payout!"></a>Bet on Orlando to beat the 224-point spread and enjoy a solid payout!</h1><p>Orlando Magic have been on a tear as of late and many basketball experts believe they have what it takes to upset the reigning champions Toronto Raptors. The odds for this matchup heavily favor the Raptors, but sports betting enthusiasts who are willing to bet on Orlando can enjoy a healthy payout.</p>
<p>The Magic come into this game with a ton of momentum, having won seven of their last 10 games. They will be looking to build off of that success by knocking off the top team in the Eastern Conference. The Raptors have been dominant at home this season, but Orlando has proven they can compete with anyone when they are playing at their best.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to make some money by betting on the Magic, make sure to do your research first. There is no doubt that Toronto is a very good team, but Orlando has been proving people wrong all season long. This could be your chance to cash in on an upset victory!</p>
<h1 id="The-Vegas-odds-are-in-Orlando’s-favor-can-they-cover-224-points"><a href="#The-Vegas-odds-are-in-Orlando’s-favor-can-they-cover-224-points" class="headerlink" title="The Vegas odds are in Orlando’s favor - can they cover 224 points?"></a>The Vegas odds are in Orlando’s favor - can they cover 224 points?</h1><p>The Orlando Magic have not been a good basketball team this season. In fact, they are one of the worst in the league. This has led to them being underdogs in almost all of their matchups, including their game against the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Vegas odds have the Warriors as -224 favorites, and many people are wondering if Orlando can cover that spread. The answer is yes, but it won’t be easy.</p>
<p>Orlando averages just 99.8 points per game this season, which is third-worst in the NBA. However, Golden State has been much worse defensively, allowing 107.4 points per game. If Orlando can get over 100 points in this game, they will have a good chance of winning straight up.</p>
<p>One thing that could help Orlando in this matchup is the absence of Stephen Curry. Curry is out with an ankle injury, and he is Golden State’s best player. Without him, the Warriors are not as strong offensively.</p>
<p>Overall, Orlando is not a good team, but they do have a chance to pull off the upset against Golden State on Wednesday night. If you’re looking to gamble on this game, the Magic may be worth a bet</p>

<p>According to OddsShark, Orlando is a nine-point favorite and is expected to beat the 224-point spread. The Magic have been playing well lately, while Memphis has been struggling.</p>
<p>In their last meeting, which took place on November 10th, Orlando won 119-107. This was also the last time that Memphis lost a game.</p>
