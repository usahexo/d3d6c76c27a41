This game is called Cachito and is quite popular in the country. The object of the game is to score as many points as possible by matching dominoes.</p>
<p>Each player is dealt seven dominoes, which they must keep concealed from the other players. The player who holds the double-six tile begins the game and play passes to the left. On a player’s turn, they must play one domino from their hand, connecting it to one end of the chain already played. If the player cannot play, they must draw from the boneyard until they can play.</p>
<p>The winner is the first player to play all their dominoes, or the player with the fewest dominoes at the end of the game. The winner scores points for each pip on their remaining dominoes. The first player to reach 100 points (or more) wins the game.</p>

It is a variation of the traditional dominoes game that is played with 32 tiles.</p>
<p>The tiles are numbered 1-16, with each number appearing twice. The aim of the game is to score points by forming combinations of matching numbers on the tiles. Play passes clockwise around the table, and each player must draw one tile from the bag and place it face up in front of them.</p>
<p>If a player can form a combination using two or more tiles, they can claim those tiles and put them in front of them. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.</p>
<p>This new casino game should be popular among players in Costa Rica, as well as tourists who are visiting the country.</p>

Dubbed “King’s32”, the game is said to be a cross between blackjack and poker, with players trying to make the best five-card hand possible.</p>
<p>Casino executive Santiago Zapata said that the game has been in development for over two years and has already been beta-tested in several local casinos. He believes that King’s32 will be popular with both novice and experienced casino players.</p>
<p>The game will use a standard deck of 52 cards plus the 32 Chinese dominoes. The dominoes are used as wildcards, with players being able to create hands such as three aces, four kings, or five of a kind.</p>
<p>Zapata said that King’s32 offers “more excitement and higher payouts” than traditional casino games. He added that the game can be played by up to six people at a time, making it ideal for small groups or couples.</p>
<p>King’s32 is expected to launch in Costa Rican casinos in early 2019.</p>
