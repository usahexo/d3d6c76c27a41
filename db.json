Insulin is a hormone that helps the body convert sugar, starches, and other food into energy. The three common types of diabetes are type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, and gestational diabetes.\n\nType 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease where the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin. This type of diabetes usually develops in children and young adults, and people with type 1 diabetes must take insulin every day to survive.\n\nType 2 diabetes is the most common type of diabetes and accounts for about 90% of all cases. In this type of diabetes, the body does not use insulin well and the pancreas may not produce enough insulin. People with type 2 diabetes often need to take medication to control their blood sugar level.\n\nGestational diabetes is a form of Type 2 Diabetes that occurs during pregnancy when blood sugar levels are too high. Most women who have gestational diabetes can control their blood sugar levels by modifying their diet and exercising regularly. However, some women will require medication or insulin treatment to keep their blood sugar levels under control.","source":"_posts/What-is-.md","raw":"---\ntitle: What is \ndate: 2022-08-29 23:47:09\ntags:\n---\n\n\n#  What is ?\n\n, or simply known as \"Bitcoin,\" is a digital asset and a payment system invented by Satoshi Nakamoto.

Insulin is a hormone that helps the body convert sugar, starches, and other food into energy. The three common types of diabetes are type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, and gestational diabetes.\n\nType 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease where the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin. This type of diabetes usually develops in children and young adults, and people with type 1 diabetes must take insulin every day to survive.\n\nType 2 diabetes is the most common type of diabetes and accounts for about 90% of all cases. In this type of diabetes, the body does not use insulin well and the pancreas may not produce enough insulin. People with type 2 diabetes often need to take medication to control their blood sugar level.\n\nGestational diabetes is a form of Type 2 Diabetes that occurs during pregnancy when blood sugar levels are too high. Most women who have gestational diabetes can control their blood sugar levels by modifying their diet and exercising regularly. However, some women will require medication or insulin treatment to keep their blood sugar levels under control.","slug":"What-is-","published":1,"updated":"2022-08-29T15:47:09.141Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cl7exor6j000254v5abs14yll","content":"<h1 id=\"What-is\"><a href=\"#What-is\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"What is ?\"></a>What is ?</h1><p>, or simply known as “Bitcoin,” is a digital asset and a payment system invented by Satoshi Nakamoto.

The first beings to emerge from the Ginnungagap were the ice \ngiant Ymir and the cow Audumla. From Ymir's flesh came forth Burr, the father of all \ngiants, and from Audumla's udders flowed four rivers of milk that fed Burr and the \ngiants.\n\n\n Odin and his two brothers, Vili and Ve, were also born from the Ginnungagap. The three \nbrothers decided to create their own world, separate from that of their parents. They slew \nYmir and used his body to create the land, mountains, skies, and seas. From his blood they \ncreated the Trolls, from his bones the Dwarves, from his hair the plants and trees, and\nfrom his brains the clouds.\n\n\nThe gods then created humans from tree logs that had been carved with faces.

For many, the arrival of Santa Claus is synonymous with getting a lump sum of cash in the mail, but this year taxpayers may feel more like Scrooge McDuck than Tiny Tim. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was signed into law in December 2017, made sweeping changes to the tax code. While many individuals will see a decrease in their taxes, others will see an increase.\n\nThe biggest change to the individual tax code was the elimination of personal exemptions. Families will now be able to claim a $2000 credit per child instead. The standard deduction has also been increased, meaning that fewer people will itemize their deductions. Other changes include a decrease in the mortgage interest deduction and an increase in the estate tax exemption.\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act also made changes to the corporate tax code. The corporate tax rate was decreased from 35% to 21%. This decrease is permanent, whereas the individual tax cuts are temporary, expiring in 2026. Businesses will also be able to expense 100% of the cost of new equipment in the year it is purchased. This provision expires in 2023.\n\nWhile there are many changes to the tax code, it is important to remember that everyone's situation is different. You should consult with a qualified tax professional before making any decisions about your taxes. With careful planning, you can make sure that you get the most out of this year's tax laws.\n\n#  How To Pay Taxes On Gambling Winnings: Be Brutal About It\n\nWhen gambling, whether it’s betting on the horses or playing blackjack, you should always be aware of the tax implications. How much tax you pay on your winnings depends on how it’s classified by the IRS: as gambling income or regular income.\n\nGenerally, gambling income is taxed at a higher rate than regular income. This is because gambling is considered to be a “passive” activity, meaning that you don’t have to do anything active to earn the income (unlike, say, working a job). So if you hit it big at the slots and walk away with $10,000 in winnings, you’ll likely have to pay around $1,500 in federal taxes on that money.\n\nThat said, there are some ways to reduce your tax bill. For starters, you can deduct any gambling losses from your winnings. This can help offset some of the taxes you owe. You can also claim gambling as a business expense if you qualify; this could lower your taxable income and result in a smaller tax bill.\n\nNo matter how you slice it, though, paying taxes on gambling winnings is never going to be fun. But by being brutal about it and knowing what deductions and exemptions are available to you, you can minimize the pain.\n\n#  Taxes And Gambling: How To Make The Most Out Of Your Winnings\n\nUnless you've been living under a rock, you're probably aware that gambling is a popular pastime in the United States. In fact, it's such a big business that taxes on gambling winnings are a hot topic for discussion. But what are the rules for taxable gambling income? How do you report your winnings on your tax return? And what can you do to make the most of your gambling winnings?\n\nLet's start with the basics. Gambling income is any money or fair market value of property you receive as a result of winning a gamble. This includes cash, prizes, and in some cases, the fair market value of services or property received.\n\nGambling income is taxable regardless of whether you itemize deductions on your tax return or not. In other words, even if you don't have any other taxable income, you still have to report your gambling income. And if you hit it big at the casino and end up with a nice chunk of change, you'll likely have to pay taxes on that money.\n\nThe good news is that there are some deductions and exemptions available to taxpayers who have gambling income. For example, losses incurred while gambling can be used to offset winnings and reduce your taxable income. You can also deduct expenses related to gambling, such as travel expenses, meals, and even costs associated with your computer if you use it for gambling purposes.\n\nAs with any other type of income, it's important to keep track of your gambling earnings and losses throughout the year so that you're prepared when it's time to file your tax return. The IRS provides detailed information on how to report gambling income and losses in Publication 529, Miscellaneous Deductions. Be sure to review this publication thoroughly if you have any questions about how to report your gambling income accurately.\n\nNow that we've covered the basics, let's take a look at some tips for making the most out of your gambling winnings:\n\n-Start by tracking your winnings and losses throughout the year using a spreadsheet or tracking software. This will help ensure accuracy when filing your tax return.\n\n-If possible, try to claim losses incurred while gambling against wins. This will help reduce your taxable income and save you some money come tax time.\n\n-Consider donating some or all of your winnings to charity. Not only will this help reduce your taxable income, but it also offers potential tax benefits depending on how much money you donate and which charity you choose to give it to.\n\n-Take advantage of helpful resources like Publication 529 from the IRS. This publication offers detailed information on how to report all aspects of gambling income and losses accurately.\n\n#  Brutal Santa Game: Paying Taxes On Gambling Winnings\n\nIt's that time of year again. Time to break out the holiday cheer and stockings, and think about what fun tax planning strategies you can use before the end of the year. If you're like me, you already have your list of gifts to buy, and now it's time to think about how to pay less in taxes on those gifts.\n\nThis year, I'm going to be thinking about ways to reduce my taxable income from gambling winnings. If you're like most taxpayers, you may not realize that gambling winnings are taxable. In fact, the US Tax Code specifically requires taxpayers to report all gambling winnings as taxable income. So if you hit it big at the casino this year, be prepared to pay Uncle Sam his share.\n\nFortunately, there are a few things you can do to reduce your tax liability on gambling winnings. One easy strategy is to offset your gambling income with losses from other activities. For example, if you play poker for $500 and lose $300 during the year, you can offset your taxable gambling income by reporting the $300 loss on your tax return. This will help reduce your overall tax liability for the year.\n\nAnother way to reduce your tax liability is by deducting certain expenses associated with gambling. For example, if you travel to a casino for the sole purpose of gambling, you may be able to deduct your travel expenses as a miscellaneous deduction on Schedule A of your tax return. The same goes for any other costs associated with gambling, such as buying chips or paying for internet or cable TV services that allow access to online casinos. Just be sure to keep good records of all of your expenses so that you can accurately claim them on your return.\n\nOne last thing: don't forget that Casino Gambling Winnings are also reportable …\n\n#  Enjoy Your Christmas Gifts, Taxpayers - Brutal Santa Game Is Over\n\nThe Christmas gift game is a popular pastime enjoyed by millions of taxpayers each year. Unfortunately, the brutal Santa game is over for 2017.\n\nSome taxpayers may be wondering what gifts they can expect from the federal government this year. The answer is: nothing.\n\nThe Trump administration has proposed a \"historic\" overhaul of the U.S. tax code that would include massive tax cuts for businesses and wealthy Americans. The Tax Policy Center (TPC) estimates that the plan would reduce federal revenue by $2.4 trillion over the next decade.\n\n To make up for the lost revenue, the proposed bill would repeal many popular deductions and exemptions used by middle-class and low-income families. The TPC estimates that the average taxpayer would see their taxes increase by $2,700 in 2027.\n\nSo, while the rich get richer, the rest of us will be left to pay for it.

For many, the arrival of Santa Claus is synonymous with getting a lump sum of cash in the mail, but this year taxpayers may feel more like Scrooge McDuck than Tiny Tim. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was signed into law in December 2017, made sweeping changes to the tax code. While many individuals will see a decrease in their taxes, others will see an increase.</p>\n<p>The biggest change to the individual tax code was the elimination of personal exemptions. Families will now be able to claim a $2000 credit per child instead. The standard deduction has also been increased, meaning that fewer people will itemize their deductions. Other changes include a decrease in the mortgage interest deduction and an increase in the estate tax exemption.</p>\n<p>The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act also made changes to the corporate tax code. The corporate tax rate was decreased from 35% to 21%. This decrease is permanent, whereas the individual tax cuts are temporary, expiring in 2026. Businesses will also be able to expense 100% of the cost of new equipment in the year it is purchased. This provision expires in 2023.</p>\n<p>While there are many changes to the tax code, it is important to remember that everyone’s situation is different. You should consult with a qualified tax professional before making any decisions about your taxes. With careful planning, you can make sure that you get the most out of this year’s tax laws.</p>\n<h1 id=\"How-To-Pay-Taxes-On-Gambling-Winnings-Be-Brutal-About-It\"><a href=\"#How-To-Pay-Taxes-On-Gambling-Winnings-Be-Brutal-About-It\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"How To Pay Taxes On Gambling Winnings: Be Brutal About It\"></a>How To Pay Taxes On Gambling Winnings: Be Brutal About It</h1><p>When gambling, whether it’s betting on the horses or playing blackjack, you should always be aware of the tax implications. How much tax you pay on your winnings depends on how it’s classified by the IRS: as gambling income or regular income.</p>\n<p>Generally, gambling income is taxed at a higher rate than regular income. This is because gambling is considered to be a “passive” activity, meaning that you don’t have to do anything active to earn the income (unlike, say, working a job). So if you hit it big at the slots and walk away with $10,000 in winnings, you’ll likely have to pay around $1,500 in federal taxes on that money.</p>\n<p>That said, there are some ways to reduce your tax bill. For starters, you can deduct any gambling losses from your winnings. This can help offset some of the taxes you owe. You can also claim gambling as a business expense if you qualify; this could lower your taxable income and result in a smaller tax bill.</p>\n<p>No matter how you slice it, though, paying taxes on gambling winnings is never going to be fun. But by being brutal about it and knowing what deductions and exemptions are available to you, you can minimize the pain.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Taxes-And-Gambling-How-To-Make-The-Most-Out-Of-Your-Winnings\"><a href=\"#Taxes-And-Gambling-How-To-Make-The-Most-Out-Of-Your-Winnings\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Taxes And Gambling: How To Make The Most Out Of Your Winnings\"></a>Taxes And Gambling: How To Make The Most Out Of Your Winnings</h1><p>Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’re probably aware that gambling is a popular pastime in the United States. In fact, it’s such a big business that taxes on gambling winnings are a hot topic for discussion. But what are the rules for taxable gambling income? How do you report your winnings on your tax return? And what can you do to make the most of your gambling winnings?</p>\n<p>Let’s start with the basics. Gambling income is any money or fair market value of property you receive as a result of winning a gamble. This includes cash, prizes, and in some cases, the fair market value of services or property received.</p>\n<p>Gambling income is taxable regardless of whether you itemize deductions on your tax return or not. In other words, even if you don’t have any other taxable income, you still have to report your gambling income. And if you hit it big at the casino and end up with a nice chunk of change, you’ll likely have to pay taxes on that money.</p>\n<p>The good news is that there are some deductions and exemptions available to taxpayers who have gambling income. For example, losses incurred while gambling can be used to offset winnings and reduce your taxable income. You can also deduct expenses related to gambling, such as travel expenses, meals, and even costs associated with your computer if you use it for gambling purposes.</p>\n<p>As with any other type of income, it’s important to keep track of your gambling earnings and losses throughout the year so that you’re prepared when it’s time to file your tax return. The IRS provides detailed information on how to report gambling income and losses in Publication 529, Miscellaneous Deductions. Be sure to review this publication thoroughly if you have any questions about how to report your gambling income accurately.</p>\n<p>Now that we’ve covered the basics, let’s take a look at some tips for making the most out of your gambling winnings:</p>\n<p>-Start by tracking your winnings and losses throughout the year using a spreadsheet or tracking software. This will help ensure accuracy when filing your tax return.</p>\n<p>-If possible, try to claim losses incurred while gambling against wins. This will help reduce your taxable income and save you some money come tax time.</p>\n<p>-Consider donating some or all of your winnings to charity. Not only will this help reduce your taxable income, but it also offers potential tax benefits depending on how much money you donate and which charity you choose to give it to.</p>\n<p>-Take advantage of helpful resources like Publication 529 from the IRS. This publication offers detailed information on how to report all aspects of gambling income and losses accurately.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Brutal-Santa-Game-Paying-Taxes-On-Gambling-Winnings\"><a href=\"#Brutal-Santa-Game-Paying-Taxes-On-Gambling-Winnings\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Brutal Santa Game: Paying Taxes On Gambling Winnings\"></a>Brutal Santa Game: Paying Taxes On Gambling Winnings</h1><p>It’s that time of year again. Time to break out the holiday cheer and stockings, and think about what fun tax planning strategies you can use before the end of the year. If you’re like me, you already have your list of gifts to buy, and now it’s time to think about how to pay less in taxes on those gifts.</p>\n<p>This year, I’m going to be thinking about ways to reduce my taxable income from gambling winnings. If you’re like most taxpayers, you may not realize that gambling winnings are taxable. In fact, the US Tax Code specifically requires taxpayers to report all gambling winnings as taxable income. So if you hit it big at the casino this year, be prepared to pay Uncle Sam his share.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, there are a few things you can do to reduce your tax liability on gambling winnings. One easy strategy is to offset your gambling income with losses from other activities. For example, if you play poker for $500 and lose $300 during the year, you can offset your taxable gambling income by reporting the $300 loss on your tax return. This will help reduce your overall tax liability for the year.</p>\n<p>Another way to reduce your tax liability is by deducting certain expenses associated with gambling. For example, if you travel to a casino for the sole purpose of gambling, you may be able to deduct your travel expenses as a miscellaneous deduction on Schedule A of your tax return. The same goes for any other costs associated with gambling, such as buying chips or paying for internet or cable TV services that allow access to online casinos. Just be sure to keep good records of all of your expenses so that you can accurately claim them on your return.</p>\n<p>One last thing: don’t forget that Casino Gambling Winnings are also reportable …</p>\n<h1 id=\"Enjoy-Your-Christmas-Gifts-Taxpayers-Brutal-Santa-Game-Is-Over\"><a href=\"#Enjoy-Your-Christmas-Gifts-Taxpayers-Brutal-Santa-Game-Is-Over\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Enjoy Your Christmas Gifts, Taxpayers - Brutal Santa Game Is Over\"></a>Enjoy Your Christmas Gifts, Taxpayers - Brutal Santa Game Is Over</h1><p>The Christmas gift game is a popular pastime enjoyed by millions of taxpayers each year.
